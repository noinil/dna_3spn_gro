# Generating Coarse-Grained Model Files for Molecular Dynamics Simulations

## Description
This project helps to prepare coarse-grained (CG) model topology/coordinate files for MD simulations.
File format is in gromacs style.

## Dependencies

### python packages
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

### other
- [3dna](http://x3dna.org/)

## Usage

### CG Protein (the [AICG2+](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402768111) model)

Given the native structure of a protein (or complex of proteins), the script
can generate the topology and parameter files: 
```
/path_to_gen_input_cg_gro/PRO_AICG2P/pdb2gro_aicg2p.py -s 1 xxx.pdb
```

Output:
- A topology file `xxx.itp`
- A coordinate file `xxx.gro`

### CG DNA (the [3SPN.2C](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4897649) model)

First of all, the reference structure of B-type DNA is base on the software
[3dna](http://x3dna.org/), we have to use it to create a DNA structure.

Prepare a sequence file in the `fasta` format:
```
> DNA sequence
ATGCATGCATGC...ATGC
```

Run the following:
```bash
/path_to_gen_input_cg_gro/DNA_3SPN2C/bdna_3spn2c_gen.sh xxx.fasta
```

What we get:
- An atomistic PDB file generated by [3dna](http://x3dna.org/)
- A `.gro` file with coarse-grained particles
- Two `.itp` topology files for the two strands of dsDNA

**Note**: the current version runs very slow for CG DNA, because of calling the
"select" function in MDAnalysis.  However I'm too lazy to write another code to
solve this speed problem, although we definitely need it for large biological
systems.
