# dna_3spn_gro

## Description
Generate 3SPN DNA model files for MD in the format of GRO.

## Dependencies

### python packages
- numpy
- MDAnalysis

### other
- [3dna](http://x3dna.org/)

## Usage

First of all, everything is base on the software [3dna](http://x3dna.org/), the user has to download it.

Prepare a sequence file in the `fasta` format:
```
> DNA sequence
ATGCATGCATGC...ATGC
```

Run the following:
```bash
/path_to_dna_3spn_gro/DNA3SPNGRO/bdna_3spn2c_gen.sh xxx.fasta
```

What you will get:
- An atomistic PDB file generated by [3dna](http://x3dna.org/)
- A `.gro` file with coarse-grained particles
- Two `.itp` topology files for the two strands of dsDNA
